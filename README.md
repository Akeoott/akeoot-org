## File structure:
Since it always changes, here are some general rules I follow!

#### Page directories containing the index file are:
- `/` (In root folder)
  - `index.html` (Main page)
  - `projects/index.html`
  - `contact/index.html`
- For short, every dir that isnt listed below is a page dir.

#### NOT page directories are:
- `/` (In root folder)
  - `js/`
  - `css/`
  - `images/`
  - `includes/`
