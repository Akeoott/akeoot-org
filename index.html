                        I'm Ame, primarily known as Akeoott.<br>
                        (I also go by as akeoot. <a href="/pages/contact/">Learn more about me here</a>)<br>
                        <br>
                        I'm a self tought developer enjoying everything around the web and computers!<br>
                        I started coding on <u>February 20th, 2025</u>.<br>
                        It's been an incredibly fast paced and an exciting journey since then!<br>
                        My first ever project on GitHub saw its initial commit on <u>April 29th, 2025</u>.<br>

                        <br>
                        My focus right now is coding in Python and frontend in general (html, css, js etc.)<br>
                        Going full-stack BABY!<br>
                        Once I feel that I have a well formed foundation overall,<br>
                        I want to learn C# so I can work on large fast programs.<br>

                        <br>
                        It's basically my dream.

                        This website is basically an about me.<br>
                        It contains my portfolio, plans, projects and how to contact me.<br>
                        <br>
                        Once upon a time I wanted to buy a domain.<br>
                        So did, and from then on I started building this site on cloudflare.<br>
                        And that without any frontend knowledge beforehand.<br>
